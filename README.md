# Github Project Bot

Self link: https://github.com/enterprise-enablement/project-bot

Goal of the bot is to:
- add branch protection to master and develop branches to enforce PRs

Want the bot to do something else? Request them [here](https://github.com/enterprise-enablement/project-bot/issues).

How do I keep my repo from being affected? Add a .botignore
